Feature: To be able to verify the "radio" button being selected

Scenario: radio button verification
Given I am on the "NurHome" page
And I maximize the window
When I key in "22033" in the "Location" field
And I click the "Search" button
#And I choose "State"	
#And I check "Nursing Care"
And I wait 5 seconds
And the "State" radio should be selected
And I wait 10 seconds
